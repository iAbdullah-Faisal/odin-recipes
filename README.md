# odin-recipes

1st project from TOP, after finishing the basics of HTML.
I have already an experience with HTML, so am gonna do my best to make something interesting to be seen!.

Notes After finishing the project:
I used my limited knowledge of CSS to design the output of my work.
All of the ingredients and the instructions of each recipe were generated using chatGPT "it seems he was chef:)"
