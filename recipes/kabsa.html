    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
      Kabsa is a fragrant <strong>Saudi Arabian rice dish</strong> often served
      during <em>special occasions.</em> It‚Äôs made by cooking rice with spiced
      meat (usually chicken, lamb, or beef) in a rich tomato-based broth infused
      with aromatic spices like cardamom, cloves, and cinnamon. The dish is both
      hearty and flavorful, offering a perfect blend of savory and slightly
      sweet notes.
