    <ul>
      <li>1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs</li>
      <li>1/4 cup melted butter</li>
      <li>24 oz cream cheese, softened</li>
      <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
      <li>3 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
      <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat your oven to 325¬∞F (163¬∞C). Grease a 9-inch springform pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a medium bowl, combine graham cracker crumbs and melted butter. Press
        the mixture firmly into the bottom of the prepared pan to form the
        crust.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened cream cheese until smooth and
        creamy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the sugar and vanilla extract, and continue to beat until well
        combined.
      </li>
      <li>Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.</li>
      <li>
        Mix in the sour cream and flour until just combined. Be careful not to
        overmix.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the cream cheese mixture over the crust in the springform pan,
        spreading it evenly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 55-70 minutes, or until the center is
        almost set but still slightly jiggly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn off the oven and leave the cheesecake inside with the door slightly
        open for 1 hour to cool gradually.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from the oven and let it cool completely at room temperature,
        then refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight before serving.
      </li>
    </ol>
